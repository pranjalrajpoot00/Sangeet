# Objective

1. Use React JS

2. Application should be responsive eg. In case of smaller screens, the player component can be the main interface with a menu button to show a list of songs.

   `https://cms.samespace.com/assets/{COVER_IMAGE_ID}`

4. Music should not stop playing if user visits another tab

5. Background gradient color should change according to the cover image of the song as shown in design.

6. Interface must be fluid and interactive with animation/transitions. eg. List loading animation, background color change animation etc.

7. Please submit a github repo link and if possible deploy a working demo on Vercel or Netlify.

8. Functionality needed

```
a. Search
b. Music Control â€” Play/Pause/Next/Previous
c. Tab change (e.g. For You to Top Tracks)
d. Controlling music via seeker
